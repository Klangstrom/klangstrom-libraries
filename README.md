# Klangstrom Hardware 

![KLST--app-icon](./assets/KLST--app-icon.png)    

*Klangstrom* (KLST) is an infrastructure to facilitate generative, networked, embedded sound + music + composition. *klangstrom* is comprised of two software libraries ( *klang* a node+text-based sound synthesis library and *strom* a node+text-based generative composition library ), an embedded hardware platform, and a programming environment to allow seamless development of generative, networked, embedded sound + music + composition applications.

this repository hosts the hardware designs of *Klangstrom* boards. currently the following boards have been produced:

![KLST_PANDA](./assets/KLST_PANDA.jpg)    
KLST_PANDA (v1.0a) :: handheld-style development board with audio in-+output, MIDI in-+output, 2 on-board microphones, 4.3" TFT display, SD card reader, 16 MB external memory, 2 encoders, 2 mechanical keys, rechargeable battery ( based on STM32H723ZGT )

![KLST_SHEEP](./assets/KLST_SHEEP.jpg)    
KLST_SHEEP (v0.1) :: handheld-style development board with 16 LEDs, 2 encoders, display ( based on STM32H743VI )

![KLST_TINY](./assets/KLST_TINY.jpg)    
KLST_TINY (v0.1) :: pocket-calculator-sized development board with 3 LEDs, 3 encoders ( based on STM32F446RE )

![KLST_CORE](./assets/KLST_CORE.jpg)    
KLST_CORE (v0.1) :: chunky development board designed to evaluate features like connectivity to peripherals and eurorack modules ( based on STM32H743II )
